**Git-powered project workflow** — as if you're actually building a real-world project. This version walks through Git commands _in action_ as you work on a feature, collaborate with teammates, and deploy code via GitHub.

# 🚀 Git Workflow: Building a Real-World Project

This guide follows a practical Git journey: from project setup to collaborative coding, version management, and deployment — all in a GitHub-compatible Markdown format.

---

## 🏁 1. Start the Project

### 🔹 Initialize Git and configure details
```bash
mkdir vinsys-product-app
cd vinsys-product-app
git init

git config user.name "Ravi"
git config user.email "ravi@example.com"
```

### 🔹 Create initial files and commit
```bash
echo "# VINSYS App" > README.md
echo "<!DOCTYPE html>" > index.html
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with README and homepage"
```

---

## 🌿 2. Branching for a Feature

### 🔹 Create and switch to a new branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature-login
```

### 🔹 Make changes and commit
```bash
echo "<form>Login Form</form>" >> index.html
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add login form"
```

---

## 🔀 3. Merge Feature into Main

### 🔹 Switch back to main and merge
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-login
```

> If there's no divergence, Git performs a fast-forward merge.

---

## ⚔️ 4. Resolve Merge Conflicts (if any)

If another teammate also worked on `index.html`, you'll see conflict markers:

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Their changes
>>>>>>> feature-auth
```

### 🔹 Manually edit, then commit
```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Resolve login form conflict"
```

---

## 📦 5. Stash Work During Context Switching

You're midway into building a search feature but need to quickly fix a bug.

### 🔹 Stash current changes
```bash
git stash
```

### 🔹 Switch to fix branch
```bash
git checkout -b hotfix-navbar
```

### 🔹 After resolving bug, return and reapply changes
```bash
git checkout feature-search
git stash pop
```

---

## 🔁 6. Rebase to Sync with Latest Main

Before pushing your `feature-search`:

```bash
git checkout feature-search
git rebase main
```

> Keeps history clean and linear.

---

## 🍒 7. Cherry-Pick Useful Commits

Found a useful bugfix commit in another branch?

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

---

## ⏮️ 8. Undo Mistakes

### 🔹 Revert a public commit (safe)
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### 🔹 Reset local history (use cautiously)
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

---

## 🏷️ 9. Tagging Releases

You've finished version 1.0:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"
git push origin v1.0
```

---

## 🐙 10. Push to GitHub

### 🔹 Set up remote and push
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/ravi/vinsys-product-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 📥 11. Clone and Collaborate

Your teammate wants to join:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ravi/vinsys-product-app.git
```

---

## 🧭 12. Create Git Remote Alias

```bash
git remote add vinsys https://github.com/ravi/vinsys-product-app.git
git push vinsys main
```

---

## 🔄 13. Sync with Teammates

### 🔹 Fetch updates
```bash
git fetch origin
```

### 🔹 Pull latest changes
```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## 🔍 14. Git Diagnostics and Maintenance

### 🔹 Check repo health
```bash
git fsck
```

### 🔹 Clean up garbage
```bash
git gc
```

---

## 🪝 15. Add Git Hooks

### Pre-commit hook example:
```bash
echo '#!/bin/sh
npm test' > .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

---

## 🚫 16. Manage Ignored Files

Add `.gitignore`:
```bash
node_modules/
.env
*.log
```

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files"
```

---

## ✅ Summary Flow

```text
init → branch → add/commit → merge → conflict → stash → rebase →
cherry-pick → revert/reset → tag → push/pull → fsck/gc → hooks → ignore
```
